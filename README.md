Audio Stream Music Default
==========================
Always accidentally switching your ringer volume? Want to lower the volume before you start e.g. youtube? This app sets the music stream as the default audio stream to change by the volume buttons. E.g. on home screen or in apps which don't explicitly set a stream.
Tested on Node 4 running Lollipop (Wanam Lite V3.1). Should run an all Lollipop, Kitkat and Jellybean Roms.

If your have problems, please send a pm with your logs. (Enable logging in the module, reboot, press volume buttons and then send me your xposed logs with the xposed installer app)
